I am a 32-year-old man (\ ), who lives in Roermond. I have two younger sisters (19 and 29 years old). My parents are Jehovah's Witnesses. Like many other religions, Jehovah's witnesses reject homosexuality. Jehovah's Witnesses also reject sex before marriage and masturbation. As of about 13 years old, however, I 'struggled' with masturbation. Although I am now convinced that masturbation is not a problem, all this time I suffered from an enormous sense of guilt.

I am missing out on picture in picture mode, split-screen apps, and an always on display. Used to be obsessed with flashing the latest updated kernel or ROM on my phone. Always wanting to be the first to try the new monthly security patch or whatever new feature. Squeezing every drop of performance I could through overclocking, even if it sacrificed stability.
