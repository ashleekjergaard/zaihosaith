This page provides links to both general release drivers that support Vulkan and developer beta drivers that support upcoming Vulkan features. Release Driver Downloads Vulkan 1.1 support is available for Windows and Linux in our general release drivers available here: Windows. We have been using NVIDIA hardware and drivers on both Windows and Android for Vulkan development, and the reductions in CPU overhead have been impressive.

NVIDIA Launches Special Vulkan Drivers For GeForce Graphics Cards - Kepler and Maxwell Fully Supported on Windows / Linux. Have a GTX 1060 and recently updated my nvidia drivers and game fails to launch in vulcan mode. Works fine in DirectX or OpenGL. Any suggestions. I'm confused. Is the vulcan driver rolling back? or what is happening here? And does the vulcan only affect DX12 games? or games in general to increase the performance and cpu overhead drasticly.  I've been an nVidia fanboy in the past. I have used their video cards since the Riva series, I have the Shield TV/Tablet/Portable. But it seems like their QC isn't that great software wise (reintroducing bugs with updates, twitchy behavior) and for hardware I'm about on my 3rd remote for the Android TV (1st one mic gave out, RMA replacement 2nd one volume control randomly maxes out volume without my touching it, waiting for 3rd/2nd RMA in as many months to arrive) and for my Tablet a corne.

I know this is probably an annoying question, But could someone explain Vulkan to me? Like, I thought it was for AMD users only? But I recently saw an article that say Nvidia users can benefit from it too? That completly debased what I thought it was. Honestly, I don't really understand what Vulcan really is. I know it is a Directx replacement, but not much more than that. Also, is there any way I can benefit from it now? Can I use it on my system today and see improvements?. All NVIDIA Drivers. Support. About NVIDIA. AI Computing Model. Newsroom. NVIDIA Blog.  Detonator FX Driver (44.03 or higher); 512MB System Memory; 128MB Video Memory  Angered, Vulcan attempts to crush the annoyance but it's too quick. He chases it all around his sanctuary. 
So, in DOOM 2016, if I use Vulkan indoors, the FPS can drop to about 75 FPS on a GTX 1070 and a 4790k (in a room with a gore nest on the second level) but in the same area with OpenGL, I get 100 FPS. But outdoors (and in some areas on the second level, like when you leave the room at the start of the level), the FPS is higher in Vulkan, but lower in OpenGL. Does anyone else have this issue. When will Vulkan become available to the community? When will the specs be published? When can I look at samples? What is the state of progress at the moment? I've paused work on my GL 4.5 engine pending. Vulcan - is it necessary? Guys,  But I worry I am freezing myself out of playing some of the future titles after seeing rumblings about Vulcan support  But keep in mind, the game was not built from the ground up using Vulkan and drivers from Nvidia/AMD still need to mature. 
I've read on other forums and this sub sometimes that "Nvidia forgets about supporting older GPUs but AMD GPUs get better the older they get" and so on. But I can't really find anything concrete anywhere about this statement. Does everyone agree on this? Is this common.

This mostly happens if I have opened up photoshop more than once before restarting my computer again. I am not sure what is up but I have tried all of those common fixes that they offer on adobe and things that I look for on reddit so far. When it does lag it takes 5 seconds to do anything (open menus, draw, anything) as if it is trying to load or think about what it has to do next, this does not always happen though. It seems random and it has been troubling me for a long time now, since The only drivers I see require a Tegra development board. I am using an ACER Chromebook with Tegra K1. (I also have a SAMSUNG Chromebook) Please don't tell me that shipping NVIDIA hardware is not supported. Remember this part of Michael Abrashs' OC5 2018 Keynote relating to Oculus' Eyetracking with Pixel Reconstruction Foveated Rendering: https://youtu.be/o7OpS7pZ5ok?t=5438﻿ Just wondering if any game engine programmers or Devs can give us an idea if this type of technique will be a graphics driver level, SDK level or game engine level technique. What I mean, is whether this technique needs to be built into the graphics driver and does that mean all games can be made to support it with a simple. 
The Vulkan Graphics API Is Here—and Your NVIDIA GPU Is Ready. February 16, 2016 by Neil Trevett.  Best of all, the NVIDIA drivers needed to take advantage of Vulkan are already here. On launch day we have Vulkan drivers available for Windows. Apologies for posting this here and not in the sticky, I have asked this question in last weeks thread as well as this weeks but hardly anybody seems to venture into these threads and I've had no replies so I'm asking here. Currently playing persona 5 (BLUS31604) and I'm very happy with my setup, 45-60fps at 5k. Now I've done the portrait fix but there are still some lines, I've read that this is due to resolution scaling, is there a way to fix this?

Preface: My computer is not great and I'm planning on an upgrade, however, I'd like to find out a temporary fix to my problems. The MB is a bit old, so SSDs run on SATA2, hence the bad UserBenchmark test. The games that I'm trying to run, however, run at gt60 FPS 1920x1080 (mostly Very High - Ultra settings) without any texture popping, FPS dips etc. None of these games go below 60 FPS, so for what I'm trying to play, CPU is not bottlenecking my GPU and SSDs are fast enough since https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=articleitem=nvidia-vlk-madmaxnum=1 AMD has already demonstrated similar impressive results

Summary: Build seemed to go fine, small issue with mounting the cpu heat sink fan, where I had to take it off slightly to adjust the clamp, worried maybe that the thermal paste is uneven. This is the only issue I can think of with the build, other than I put RAM in slots 1 and 3 initially. Windows 10 (64x) installed with no issues. First several hours seemed to go well. Used Ninite to download all the usual suspects. Realized that ram was in wrong so changed from 1 and 3 to 2 and 4. Tried. This download includes the NVIDIA display driver and GeForce Experience application. Details for use of this NVIDIA software can be found in the NVIDIA End User License Agreement. I got a new Founder's Edition GTX 1070 around Christmas, and I don't know what it is, but it seems to be running slow. Don't get me wrong, it's not bad, but it's not great either. It feels about the same performance-wise, maybe a little worse, as the RX 470 I had in my machine earlier. I've updated to the latest drivers so I don't think it's that. It's not thermal throttling either. Help me r/pcmasterrace.
